# squirroFrontendChallenge

Due to limited frontend knowledge, attempt was focused on getting elements onto page but failed the following:
1. Unable to CSS style elements to wireframe positioning
2. Unable to implement Book Store rating represented in stars

Points to note:
1. bookstore-ui serves on PORT 3005
2. bookstore-api serves on PORT 3000
